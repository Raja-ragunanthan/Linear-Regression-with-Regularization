# Linear-Regression-with-Regularization

# Add regularization term using   to:
1) Normal equation (Closed form solution) 5 points
2) Gradient Descent. 5 points
3) be sure to pass the regularization as a parameter to your class, so you could run your model with regularization term or without regularization term (version we saw in the class)
# Add a function to calculate the Stochastic gradient descent. 10 points
1) Be sure to pass the necessary parameters to your class so you could switch between gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.
# Add a plotting function that will plot the error costs of the gradient descent.
1) Be sure to plot the cost of your model during the training steps. 10 points
2) verify your function using test set of all the three datasets and information given in the document. 

report the RMSE and SSE over the test set for all three datasets. 

Describe your observation and what are the effects of the learning rate and regularization parameters on the learning.
