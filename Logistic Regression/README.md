For the dataset which we worked with in the class: 

write a function as part of your LogisticRegression class that we wrote in the class and call it remove_index. This function should receive an index as an input and remove the associated record from the training set. Be sure to pass remove_index function inside the run_model function on a proper location.  You want to be sure that your model will train on the data after removing the datapoint. (10 points)
Explain why removing data point number 1 and 39 has a large effect on the predicted probability of the model. (10 points)
Plot the decision boundary by removing data point number 1 and 39. (10 points)
Submit your Jupyter file which is running without error.
