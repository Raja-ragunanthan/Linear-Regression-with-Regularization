Logistic Regression
For the dataset which we worked with in the class: 

write a function as part of your LogisticRegression class that we wrote in the class and call it remove_index. This function should receive an index as an input and remove the associated record from the training set. Be sure to pass remove_index function inside the run_model function on a proper location.  You want to be sure that your model will train on the data after removing the datapoint. (10 points)
Explain why removing data point number 1 and 39 has a large effect on the predicted probability of the model. (10 points)
Plot the decision boundary by removing data point number 1 and 39. (10 points)
Submit your Jupyter file which is running without error.

Naive Bayes
For the second section of this assignment: 

Change the Gaussian Naive bayes to discrete Naive Bayes for a random dataset with n = 1000 (# of data points) and d = 2 (# of dimensions) for a binary classification y [0,1]. x1 and x2 can get any values between [0 and 1]. Following is an example of the table which you need to generate: (20 points)
x1	x2	y
0	1	1
0	0	0
1	1	1
1	0	1
 

Implement the Laplace Smoothing function for the NaiveBayes class. (20 points)
update your Naive Bayes class functions to account for a discrete classification using what we have learned in the class. (30 points)
